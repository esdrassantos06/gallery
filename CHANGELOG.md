# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here. The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Unreleased

- `captionPosition="slide"`: lay each caption over the bottom of its own image, as wide as the image, moving with the slide. New `slideCaption` class name.
- New built-in icons from [Mynaui Icons](https://mynaui.com/icons) (MIT). Same 24px grid and 1.5px stroke, so `--eg-icon-size` and custom icons work as before.
- Fix: the caption covered the controls of videos, iframes and custom players such as Video.js. Those slides now fit above the caption.
- The open and close flight now clips the image to its thumbnail, so thumbnails cropped with `object-fit: cover` grow into the full image without a jump.
- Faster image loading: the current image is fetched first at high priority, neighbors wait until it loads and then follow at low priority, and the slide's `thumbnail` shows as a placeholder until the full image arrives. New `--eg-placeholder-size` variable (`cover` by default).
- Adaptive preloading: with Save-Data or on 2G only the current image is fetched, and on 3G or devices with 2 GB of memory or less `preload` is capped at 1.
- Thousands of slides: the thumbnail strip renders only what is in view past 100 slides, the grids past 200 (the list gets `data-virtual`), and the pager shows a window of 12 dots with smaller edge dots when there are more. Grids are memoized, so they no longer re-render when the page changes slide.
- Videos: only the current video fetches metadata, neighbors use `preload="none"`. Grids and the thumbnail strip show `thumbnail`, `poster` or the YouTube poster, and never load a video file as an image. New `previewOf(slide)` export with the same rule.
- Load status and natural sizes are kept for the 300 most recently seen slides.
- Fix: a malformed download URL now reaches `download.onError` instead of throwing.

## 1.1.0 (2026-11-02)

- Fix: in right-to-left layouts the counter read "12 / 1" and English captions moved their full stop to the start. The counter and caption now take their direction from their own text (`dir="auto"`).
- Toolbar overflow: on narrow screens the buttons that do not fit move into an accessible "More options" menu (menu button pattern), zoom first; close stays visible. On by default, `toolbarOverflow={false}` turns it off.
- `idle`: fade the top bar, arrows, caption, thumbnails and pager out after a pause, back on any input; never while a control has keyboard focus or the pointer.
- Right-to-left: `dir`, or the inherited direction, mirrors arrows, swipes, arrow keys, thumbnails, pager and toolbar.
- Pinch to close: a pinch from fit released under the fitted size closes the viewer, unless it zoomed in first. On by default, `pinchToClose={false}` turns it off. A zoomed or pinched image now flies back to its thumbnail from where it is on screen.
- `flip`: flip horizontally and vertically, composing with rotation and zoom.
- `share`: Web Share with a copy-link fallback and no third-party scripts.
- `pager`: accessible pager dots next to or instead of the thumbnail strip.
- New labels, icons, class names (`menu`, `menuItem`, `pager`, `pagerDot`) and `--eg-menu-*` and `--eg-pager-*` variables for all of the above.
- The counter no longer wraps when the toolbar is full.

- Optional `MasonryGrid`, `JustifiedGrid` and `UniformGrid` with responsive columns or row height, lazy `srcset` thumbnails without layout shift and a `ref` that plugs into `getThumbnail`, plus a `GalleryFilter` with `aria-pressed` toggle buttons and a live count. Each works with or without the lightbox, and they are tree-shaken away when unused.

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-02)

First release.

- Accessible lightbox: thumbnail flight on open and close, keyboard, swipe and flick navigation, `slide`, `fade` and `zoom` transitions, captions, preloading with `srcset`, focus trap and return, scroll lock.
- Thumbnail strip, zoom (wheel, double click or tap, pinch, pan, buttons, keys), fullscreen, image loading and error states.
- Video files with sources and caption tracks, YouTube through `youtube-nocookie.com`, Vimeo, iframe slides and a slideshow with a progress bar.
- `useLightboxHash` for deep links with back-button close, rotation and downloads.
- Works with custom players such as Video.js 10: the slideshow drives any native `<video>` in the current slide, and drags and keys that content handles are left to it (`[data-eg-no-gestures]`, `event.preventDefault()`).
- Fully themeable through `--eg-*` variables, `labels`, `icons`, `classNames` and `render`.
